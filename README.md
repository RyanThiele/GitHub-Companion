## Contributing
### Branching
Currently there is a rule to protect the master branch. All changes and bug fixes must go through a pull request process. So be sure to branch from the master before pushing changes to the repository.

### Pull Requests
When creating a pull request, an Azure Pipeline will run checks against the branch and see if the branch ios valid. This may take several minutes. Please be patient. One the checks have been made, the status of the pull request will be updated.
